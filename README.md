## Rescue Protocol

Rescue Protocol is a top-down sci-fi bullet hell roguelike. The goal is to survive as long as possible by rescuing survivors scattered around the map. Rescuing a survivor will increase your health, but also increase the size of your party, making you an easier target to hit. As you progress through the rounds of enemy waves, their numbers and attack styles will increase, making it more challenging to protect yourself against them. There will be some buffs you can obtain between certain rounds, and some temporary powerups across the map that change each round. All together creating a repayable, high score-based game to challenge yourself in.
